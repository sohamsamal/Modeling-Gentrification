# Modeling Gentrification Process

This project simulates the process of gentrification using a Cellular Automata (CA) model. The model tracks changes in household income, property prices, desirability, and vacancy status over time, providing valuable insights into urban dynamics.

## Checkpoint 2 Progress

### Time-Step Visualization

We have updated the framework to store each time step in the `HISTORY` variable. Using a slider widget from matplotlib, we created a discrete timeline that allows users to scroll forwards and backwards through the simulation and visualize changes in state variables (`H`, `PP`, `D`, `VS`) over time. The following figure shows the evolution of property prices, desirability, and vacancy levels over multiple timesteps.

</div>

### Testing

#### Whole-Run Testing
The `HISTORY` variable accurately records all changes during the simulation. This is crucial for debugging and analyzing results as it provides a complete record of the boardâ€™s state at each time step. Tests confirm:
- Each call to `update()` appends a copy of the board's state to `HISTORY`.
- The `terminate()` function adds the final state, even if no updates occur.

Unit tests for this functionality can be found in `classes/TestHistoryValidation.py`.

### Visualization Cleanup

To improve clarity, we updated visualizations with:
- Legends, labels, and a consistent color scheme for cell states.
- Heatmaps showing changes over time (e.g., `t=0`, `t=1`).

These updates enhance the readability and allow better tracking of features like household income, property price, desirability, and vacancy status throughout the simulation.

### New Graph Implementation

We introduced a new stacked bar chart to track the distribution of cell features over time. This macro-level view helps observe how the distribution of cell states evolves, enabling the identification of trends and patterns. Below is an example visualization:

The graph relies on data from the `HISTORY` variable to count cell states and track changes over time.


## Remaining Tasks

Our progress so far includes:
- Testing and visualization of results.
- A working CA model initialized with random data.

### Next Steps:
- Switch from a randomly initialized grid to a grid based on predefined formulas for increased accuracy.
- Document group contributions.
- Create a video to explain our work and results.
